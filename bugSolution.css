To resolve the issue, avoid combining `@apply` with other CSS within the same class.  Instead, create separate classes to manage styles independently.  For instance, refactor the problematic class like this:

```css
.bg-padding {
  @apply bg-blue-500;
}

.my-class {
  @apply bg-padding;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```

This approach ensures that `@apply` is processed correctly without interfering with other style rules. Alternatively, you could move the `padding` to a separate class that is combined with `@apply`.
